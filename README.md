#Crunchbase API Data Tool


##Setting up
Install everything in `requirements.txt`. The best practice here is to create a virtualenv (either with virtualenvwrapper or by putting it here in the folder), and then doing `pip install -r requirements.txt`

##Running Tests
Assuming everything installed, then you should be able to run the tests by running
    
	py.test test.py

This nicely symmetrical line will then run all the test cases.
